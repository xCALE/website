This WP will aim to define models for knowledge and skills learning, and Self-Regulated Learning, providing interpretable indicators, triggers and recommendations, as a basic set for designing interactions.
## Task 3.1: Bayesian network design.
Bayesian networks will aim to integrate learning data from the platform in order to provide accurate measures of cognitive and meta-cognitive learning. Success indicators: Accuracy and performance of the model will be monitored
## Task 3.2: Model interface design.
Designing appropriate indicators, triggers and recommendations to support interactions defined in specifications will enable model integration with pedagogical support.
