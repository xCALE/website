This WP will aim to define a precise setup of the project’s roadmap along scientific, development, and experimental aspects, and derive specifications among different WPs. This setup will be guided by a comprehensive list of use cases. This WP will initiate work of the first iteration.
## Task 1.1: Experimental protocol specifications.
A methodology will be defined, dedicated tools specified to measure and analyse awareness and evolution of self-regulation among learners. Success indicator: independence between the measure of the protocol and those defined in use cases.

## Task 1.2: Use cases specifications.
A provision of use cases will be produced that will cover the project’s objectives. A first use case will be selected to initiate first iteration planning. Success indicator: A comprehensive list of use cases, providing uniform progression among scientific issues and software development in line with project objectives, with a consensus for the first use case to be implemented.
## Task 1.3: Breakdown of specifications among WPs.
This will ensure clear objectives for each WP, and required coordination. Success indicator: Clear distribution and dependencies across WPs
